        <p>it was a cold crisp winter day.
            I sit in my cabin as I slowly work through the day,
            often breaking my stature for an elixir for my mind...
            A distraction really, but who's to witness.
        </p>

        <p>
            I often find myself missing. Lost. Not in my room, or house even.
            In a moments notice, I awake to find I'm procrastinating as always.
            Nothing new to me, but probably necessary to <em>some</em> degree.
